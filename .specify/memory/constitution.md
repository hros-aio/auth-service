# Enterprise HRMS Backend Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Architecture & Layering
All service implementations MUST strictly follow Clean Architecture layering: Controller (transport) -> Service (business logic/use case orchestration) -> Repository (data access). Dependencies MUST point inward. A repository MUST NOT call a service. A controller MUST NOT access a repository or database directly. 
- *Rationale*: Enforces strict separation of concerns, keeps transport details independent of business rules, and simplifies testing and maintainability.

### II. Bounded Contexts & Bounded Databases
Each microservice corresponds to a single domain bounded context and MUST own its database schema exclusively. Cross-service database queries or joins are forbidden. Cross-service boundaries are strictly network-enforced and communication MUST happen only via versioned REST APIs or Kafka events.
- *Rationale*: Prevents database-level coupling, allowing individual services to scale and deploy independently without affecting other domains.

### III. Shared Library-First Approach
All domain-agnostic shared infrastructure and utility logic MUST reside in published, versioned shared library npm packages (`@hrms/libs-core`, `@hrms/libs-sql`, and `@hrms/libs-apis`). Duplicate code is forbidden. If a logic pattern is used in three or more places across domain services, it MUST be refactored into a shared library.
- *Rationale*: Avoids logic duplication, standardizes cross-cutting concerns (logging, authentication, database configurations), and makes the entire system easier to update.

### IV. Strict Type Safety & Code Cleanliness
The TypeScript configuration MUST have `strict: true` enabled and must never be bypassed. The use of `any` is forbidden; use `unknown` and narrow the type when shapes are undetermined. Every exported API, function, and class member MUST declare an explicit return type. Functions MUST remain small and focused (under 30 lines where possible).
- *Rationale*: Catches contract violations at compile-time to guarantee that payroll, leave, and compliance business rules do not fail silently.

### V. Test-Driven Development & Quality Gates
Every pull request introducing new business logic MUST be covered by unit tests. Mocks MUST be used at architectural boundaries, never within a layer. Integration tests using real databases/cache via Testcontainers are required for persistence logic. CI pipelines MUST enforce strict coverage thresholds: 90% Statements, 90% Functions, and 85% Branches.
- *Rationale*: Prevents regressions, guarantees implementation correctness, and provides a runnable specification of the business rules.

## Technical and Operational Standards

### 1. Project Philosophy
This project is built to deliver an enterprise-grade HRMS backend. It enforces Clean Architecture, Modular Design, and SOLID design principles. It values the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle for shared infrastructure, and the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle for domain implementations. Solutions MUST prioritize maintainability, reliability, and long-term readability over clever abstractions.

### 2. Architecture Principles
- **SRP (Single Responsibility)**: Split classes and services that perform unrelated functions (e.g., separating payroll calculations from notification delivery).
- **OCP (Open/Closed)**: Model extensible behaviors (like approval workflows or notification channels) as strategy providers injected via factories rather than branching `if/else` logic.
- **LSP (Liskov Substitution)**: Inherited repositories and entities must fully adhere to base class behaviors without narrowing their contracts.
- **ISP (Interface Segregation)**: Prefer small, client-specific interfaces (e.g., `Readable`, `Writable`) over large repositories.
- **DIP (Dependency Inversion)**: Services depend on repository interfaces or tokens rather than concrete database classes.
- **Dependency Direction**: Within a service, modules can depend on each other only through exported providers (`index.ts`). Across services, dependencies are network-enforced REST/Kafka contracts.

### 3. Technology Standards
- **Framework**: NestJS (latest stable) for opinionated modular structure and first-class DI.
- **Language**: TypeScript (v5.x+) for compile-time safety and self-documenting code.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (v15+) for relational data modeling, transaction guarantees, and robust indexing.
- **ORM**: TypeORM for native NestJS decorator integration, active-record-free patterns, and migrations.
- **Cache**: Redis for session storage, cached permission lookups, and slow-moving configuration data.
- **Authentication**: JWT RS256 (asymmetric signing). Auth service holds the private key; all other services verify with the public key.
- **Validation**: `class-validator` + `class-transformer` for edge DTO checking, integrated with a global `ValidationPipe` that strips unvalidated fields.
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI generated directly from code decorators on controllers and DTOs.
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Commitlint.

### 4. Repository Organization
Repositories are organized as single, deployable standalone services (Polyrepo layout: `hrms-<domain>-service`). Inside each repository, code is structured as NestJS modules:
- `src/modules/<domain>/`: Standard domain module structure:
  - `controllers/`: Thin HTTP handlers, Swagger decorators, DTO mappings. Business logic and direct DB/repository access are forbidden.
  - `services/`: Core business logic, rule validation, transaction management, caching decisions. Service methods MUST NOT access HTTP `Request`/`Response` objects.
  - `repositories/`: Custom query logic, joins, and pagination. Business rule evaluation is forbidden.
  - `entities/`: Database schema representations. Input validation decorators are forbidden.
  - `dto/`: Immutable request/response shapes (using `readonly` fields).
  - `interfaces/` / `enums/`: Compile-time contracts and stable named domain concepts.
  - `index.ts`: Barrel file exposing public providers only. Internal details MUST remain hidden.
- `src/kafka/`: Service-specific consumers and producers for cross-service events.
- `src/migrations/`: Service-specific database migrations (one schema per microservice).
- `src/main.ts`: Application bootstrap file configuring global filters, versioning, and Swagger.

#### Shared Libraries (Consumed as npm packages)
- **`@hrms/libs-core`**: Contains the `CacheManager`, `AppLogger` (structured JSON logging via Pino), standard exceptions (`BaseException` hierarchy), and stateless utilities.
- **`@hrms/libs-sql`**: Contains the shared TypeORM config, `BaseEntity` (id, timestamps, version, and `deletedAt`), `BaseRepository`, pagination helpers, and `AuditSubscriber`.
- **`@hrms/libs-apis`**: Contains Swagger configuration, URI versioning, CORS rules, `JwtAuthGuard`, `PermissionGuard` (`@Permissions()`), and standard request/response DTOs.

### 5. Coding Standards
- **File Naming**: Pattern `<name>.<type>.ts` in kebab-case and singular domain noun (e.g., `employee-summary.interface.ts`).
- **Code Naming**:
  - Class: PascalCase, suffixed by role (e.g., `EmployeeService`).
  - Interface: PascalCase, without `I` prefix (e.g., `EmployeeSummary`).
  - Type: PascalCase.
  - Enum: PascalCase name, PascalCase or SCREAMING_SNAKE members with explicit string values (e.g., `EmploymentStatus.Active = 'active'`).
  - Method/Function/Variable: camelCase. Verb-first for functions (e.g., `calculateLeaveBalance()`).
  - Boolean: prefix with `is`, `has`, `can`, or `should` (e.g., `isActive`).
  - Constant/Injection Token: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `EMPLOYEE_REPOSITORY`).
- **TypeScript Usage**:
  - Prefer `interface` for data contracts; `type` for unions/tuples/utility mappings.
  - Use `class` for NestJS DI targets or TypeORM entities.
  - Use `abstract class` only for shared implementation code (e.g., `BaseRepository`).
  - Do not use default exports; use named exports exclusively.
  - One exported concept per file, matching the filename.
- **File Layout Standard**:
  1. Static readonly fields
  2. Instance fields (injected dependencies first, `private readonly`)
  3. Constructor
  4. Public methods (in caller order)
  5. Private methods (in caller order)
- **Imports**: Grouped and alphabetized: (1) Node modules, (2) `@hrms/libs-*` packages, (3) local relative imports.

### 6. API Standards
- **Restful Naming**: URI paths MUST use plural, kebab-case nouns (e.g., `/api/v1/leave-requests`).
- **HTTP Mapping**: Map HTTP status codes strictly (200 for successful queries, 201 for creations, 400 for input validation errors, 401 for missing auth, 403 for insufficient permissions, 404 for missing entities, 409 for conflicts, 422 for business validations, 5xx for infrastructure failures).
- **Versioning**: URI-based versioning is mandatory (`/api/v1/...`). Additive changes stay within the same major version; breaking changes require a new version.
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints MUST implement offset/cursor pagination using the `libs-sql` paginate utility. Unbounded `findAll()` is forbidden.
- **Validation**: Incoming requests MUST use class-validator DTOs.
- **Errors**: Domain code throws typed exceptions extending `BaseException`. Global exception filter handles formatting.
- **Responses**: Enforced JSON response structure via `@hrms/libs-apis` `ResponseInterceptor`.
- **Swagger**: Every endpoint and DTO property MUST be fully decorated to maintain OpenAPI spec sync.

### 7. Database Rules
- **Transactions**: Explicit transactions MUST be used for multi-statement writes that require atomic guarantees. Single-row CRUD operations do not require transactions.
- **N+1 Prevention**: Loops containing database calls (e.g., `await repo.find()`) are strictly forbidden. Use relational joins or DataLoader batching.
- **Optimistic Locking**: Apply `@VersionColumn()` to tables subject to high concurrent updates (e.g., leave balances). Handle `OptimisticLockVersionMismatchError` gracefully.
- **Soft Delete**: Entities inheriting `BaseEntity` use `deletedAt` for soft-deletion. Hard deletion is reserved for audit-logged GDPR purges.
- **Indexes**: Mandatory on foreign keys, `WHERE` clauses, and list sorting columns. Lead with `tenant_id` for composite keys in multi-tenant schemas.
- **Migrations**: Database updates must use hand-reviewed migrations under `src/migrations/`. `synchronize: false` in non-local environments. Every migration MUST include a `down()` rollback method.

### 8. Cache Rules
- **Redis Integration**: Use the `@hrms/libs-core` `CacheManager` namespaces. Direct `ioredis` imports are forbidden in domain modules.
- **Keys**: Standardized namespacing `<domain>:<entity>:<id>`.
- **TTL**: Explicit TTLs are mandatory for all cache entries.
- **Invalidation**: Invalidation MUST occur actively in the service layer as part of the write transaction.
- **What to cache**: Sessions, resolved RBAC permissions, and slow-moving configuration tables.
- **What not to cache**: Mutable transactional data (in-flight request workflows, attendance records).

## Development Lifecycle, Testing, and Security

### 1. Security Standards
- **Asymmetric JWT Verification**: The authentication service signs tokens with a private key; all other microservices verify tokens using the public key. Symmetric keys are forbidden.
- **Edge Authentication**: All APIs MUST be authenticated. The browser session cookie MUST use security flags: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax (or Strict), and the name prefix `__Host-` or `__Secure-`.
- **Stateless Tokens**: Validate the `exp` claim and enforce the correct signature algorithm. Reject any token with a `none` algorithm.
- **RBAC**: Access permissions MUST be verified at the controller level using `PermissionGuard` and the `@Permissions()` decorator. Service-level checks verify database resource ownership.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All queries MUST use TypeORM query builders or parameterized bindings. No string interpolation in SQL sinks.
- **Data Protection**: Full PII (SSN, credit cards) MUST be masked in response bodies (`***-***-1234`). No credentials, CSRF tokens, or PII can be output in log files.
- **Secure File Handling**: Sanitize all uploaded filenames (e.g., using `path.basename()`). Upload directories MUST exist outside the web root, be non-executable, and restrict access through authorization logic. Serve uploads with `Content-Disposition: attachment` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- **Process Executions**: Do not pass raw inputs to command sinks (`exec`, `spawn`). Match paths and arguments against a strict allow-list.

### 2. Testing Standards
- **Pyramid Focus**: 70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E.
- **Unit Tests**: Test classes in isolation, mocking all collaborators. Use Nest's `Test.createTestingModule` + `overrideProvider`. Call `jest.clearAllMocks()` in `afterEach` to prevent test contamination.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify service logic and ORM mappings against PostgreSQL and Redis using Testcontainers. Wrap assertions in database transactions that roll back afterward.
- **E2E Tests**: Use `supertest` against a fully bootstrapped Nest instance. Mock only third-party integrations (emails, payment gateways).
- **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert blocks MUST be clearly defined and visually separated.
- **Naming**: Test files must follow `<name>.spec.ts` (unit/integration) or `<name>.e2e-spec.ts` (E2E) conventions.

### 3. Performance Principles
- **Database Minimization**: Query only the required columns (avoid `select *`) and request only necessary relations.
- **Batch Processing**: Use queue workers (BullMQ/Kafka) for bulk updates and report generation, returning job tokens immediately to HTTP clients.
- **Bulk CRUD**: Use TypeORM `createQueryBuilder().insert().values([...])` or `upsert()` for multi-row operations instead of looping single saves.
- **Concurrency**: Leverage database optimistic locking to handle concurrent updates rather than pessimistic thread-locking.

### 4. Pull Request Standards
- **Conventional Commits**: Every commit MUST match the conventional commits specification (e.g., `feat(employee): add bulk import`, `fix(leave): correct balance`).
- **PR Gating**:
  - Standard checklist: All tests pass, lint rules are satisfied, coverage thresholds are met, and manual self-review has removed all debugging leftovers.
  - Reviewer criteria: Thin controllers, focused services under 300 lines, SQL query indexes defined in migrations, complete Swagger documentation.

### 5. AI Agent Rules
Every AI-assisted implementation inside this repository MUST strictly follow these rules:
1. **Constitution First**: Read and follow this constitution before writing any code.
2. **Architecture Integrity**: Never introduce new architectural layers, design patterns, or frameworks without explicit team justification.
3. **Shared First**: Always search and reuse patterns from `@hrms/libs-core`, `@hrms/libs-sql`, and `@hrms/libs-apis` before writing new helper logic.
4. **No Duplication**: Do not copy or duplicate logic within or across modules.
5. **Layout Adherence**: Keep files in their designated folder structure exactly (e.g., controllers in `controllers/`, DTOs in `dto/`).
6. **Business in Services**: Encapsulate all business rules and operations inside NestJS services; keep controllers thin and transport-only.
7. **Database Isolation**: Repositories MUST only interact with the database; do not put business rules or DTO maps inside them.
8. **Composition over Inheritance**: Inject collaborators instead of subclassing (except when extending `BaseRepository`/`BaseEntity`).
9. **Focused Units**: Keep functions short, focused, and single-responsibility.
10. **Production-Ready**: Write clean, fully implemented code. Do not write mock implementations or comments like `// TODO: implement later`.
11. **Auto-Compliance**: Automatically ensure all new files satisfy ESLint naming patterns and Prettier formatting rules.
12. **Testability**: Ensure every new service method is testable in isolation.
